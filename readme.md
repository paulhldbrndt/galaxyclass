Accompanying repository to the deep learning project that I completed for [PH0101](https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/org/cc/mh/PH0101/)

## Presentation

Check out the [written report](report/galaxyclass.html), where I walk you through the entire workflow for this project, including exploratory data analysis, image preprocessing and finally building a convolutional neural network (CNN) with TensorFlow and the Keras API.

## Installation
 Download the source code
 ```bash
 $ git clone https://github.com/paulphys/galaxyclass
  ```
 The source code already includes instructions for downloading the dataset, but in case you want to get it separately
 ```bash
 $ curl -LO https://physics.sh/galaxyclass-data.zip
```

## Usage
Start the notebook
 ```bash
 $ jupyter-notebook galaxyclass.ipynb
```
